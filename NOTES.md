# Notes 

## The `.no-js` Class
There is a .no-js class on the page-header class. I think that would mean I would have to have class="no-js" added to the html tag and then run a bit of code like 
```javascript
document.documentElement.classList.remove('no-js');
```
 at the top of my script. I would need to clarify this.

## Responsiveness

I have not had the time to work on media queries for different screen sizes, if I get a chance tomorrow I will take a look at this as I built it in grid I would be able to stack the elements with media queries.

## Line in footer 

I know the line in the footer needs to go the whole way across but the wrapper is in the way - I would have to work on this!

## Resume icon not inline

## Radius input

I haven't been able to work on the arrow for this - it is not faithful to the design and the input needs styling worked on.

## Screen readers

I have tried to keep in mind how you would tab through the page and grouped sections together - so the ads are grouped together in 'careers.njk' and the advice is grouped together. This is as far as I understand it - I know I have alot more to learn

## Interactions 

There are a couple of introduced interactions hovers etc.. but I would work on button styling etc...

## model.js

I can see my linter has picked up an error that I have yet to get round to investigating. I would also in real life be getting alot of this information I am assuming from an api. I would probably have used typescript in production.
