# Notes 

## The `.no-js` Class
There is a .no-js class on the page-header class. I think that would mean I would have class="no-js" added to the html tag and then run a bit of code like 
```javascript
document.documentElement.classList.remove('no-js');
```
 at the top of my script. I would need to clarify this.
